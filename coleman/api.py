coleman.api - Library-first public API.

External projects can ``pip install coleman`` and drive experiments
programmatically via :func:`run`, :func:`run_many`, or :func:`sweep`.

Functions
---------
run
    Execute a single experiment from a resolved ``RunSpec``.
run_many
    Execute multiple specs, optionally in parallel.
sweep
    Expand a base spec × sweep definition and return concrete specs.
load_spec
    Load and validate a ``RunSpec`` from YAML (with pack resolution).
save_resolved
    Persist a resolved spec as canonical JSON.
