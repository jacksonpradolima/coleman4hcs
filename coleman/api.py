coleman.api - Library-first public API.

External projects can install a COLEMAN GitHub release wheel and drive experiments
programmatically via :func:`run`, :func:`run_many`, or :func:`sweep`.

Functions
---------
run
    Execute a single experiment from a resolved ``RunSpec``.
run_many
    Execute multiple specs, optionally in parallel.
sweep
    Expand a base spec × sweep definition and return concrete specs.
load_spec
    Load and validate a ``RunSpec`` from YAML (with pack resolution).
save_resolved
    Persist a resolved spec as canonical JSON.

    Parameters
    ----------
    spec : RunSpec
        Validated configuration, including dataset paths, policies, rewards,
        budgets and optional checkpoint, result and telemetry settings.

    Returns
    -------
    RunResult
        Resolved specification, configuration-derived run ID and artifact
        directory. ``metrics`` is currently empty; inspect native result files
        for per-build observations.

    Raises
    ------
    OSError
        If configuration/provenance cannot be persisted or execution encounters
        an unsuppressed filesystem error.

    Notes
    -----
    Writes resolved configuration and provenance before execution beneath
    ``spec.results.out_dir / compute_run_id(spec)``. Native results and enabled
    checkpoints use that run directory; an enabled manifest is generated afterward.
    A directory's existence does not certify a successful run.

    Resume requires compatible input bytes, runtime and configuration. The run ID
    hashes configuration with legacy normalization rules; it does not hash all
    external dataset bytes. The runner replays recorded outcomes rather than
    launching the subject's test commands. Execution errors propagate according
    to the native runner's error-handling contracts.

    extension : RunnerExtension
        Runner extension receiving native lifecycle callbacks. Worker callbacks
        execute in their owning process and must respect its state boundaries.

    Returns

    Parameters

        and output/checkpoint namespace.
    max_workers : int, optional
        Number of specification-level workers. Values at most one select the
