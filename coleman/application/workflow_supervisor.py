    ----------
    root : pathlib.Path
        Trusted persistent POSIX workspace. A fixed detached Python process inherits

    Raises
    ------
    OSError, ValueError
        Unsupported/unsafe storage or spawn failure. Existing queued records remain
        recoverable by reopening the workspace and retrying the same request.
        Missing acknowledgement raises a safe retryable WorkflowError; it never
        silently returns an unobserved queue as healthy.

    Notes
    -----
    Waits up to ten seconds for an actual queue observation. A retiring child can
    close its descriptor while an old parent still retains another copy; this
    bounded handshake retries that interval. Work is durably admitted first, so
    an acknowledgement timeout requires retrying the same request, not a new job.
