    Parameters
    ----------
    root : pathlib.Path
        Trusted private POSIX local workspace. No operation accepts an untrusted
        path, URL, plugin, shell command or native specification override.
    owner : str
        Trusted local principal, never supplied by tool arguments. Caller-bound
        plans/jobs/imports are isolated; the dataset registry is host-owned.
    policy : HostPolicy or None
        Initial finite caps. A conflicting policy on reopen rejects explicitly.

    Notes
    -----
    Uses short SQLite transactions, immutable artifacts and kernel execution locks.
    Native execution is detached into fixed package subprocesses. Disconnect/close
    does not cancel work. Reopening reconciles lost ownership as interrupted;
    continuation is explicit and rechecks producer/data/configuration compatibility.
    Only trusted local hosts on Linux/macOS local storage are supported. Resource
    sampling is not a hostile-code sandbox or a distributed exactly-once guarantee.
