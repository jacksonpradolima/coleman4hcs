    Parameters
    ----------

        Complete plan/trial compatibility fingerprint, including data and runtime.
    algorithm : str
        Explicit NumPy PCG64 contract. Another generator requires a new reviewed codec.
    state, increment : int
        Unsigned 128-bit generator state/stream integers, not seeds or observations.
    has_uint32, uinteger : int
        Cached unsigned 32-bit state, required for faithful shuffle continuation.

    Notes
    -----
    Stored as canonical versioned JSON in native CheckpointPayload.extra, alongside
    the existing agents/bandit. No native payload/progress format is changed. Old
    checkpoints lacking this workflow binding reject rather than silently reseed.

    ----------

    binding : str
        Exact frozen workflow/trial fingerprint, verified before restoring RNG state.

    Notes
    -----
    Inherits the existing native checkpoint publication/recovery semantics. Only
    trusted host-owned pickle state is loaded; portable exports exclude all of it.
    Moving a native checkpoint to another root is unsupported and rejects its
    absolute progress-path binding. Native checkpoints outside workflows are unchanged.
    Uses the native process-global generator: callers must run in an isolated
    single native worker, as the workflow coordinator does, never concurrent threads.
