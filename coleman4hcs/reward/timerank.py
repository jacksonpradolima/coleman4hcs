    This reward function explicitly includes the order of test cases and rewards
    each test case based on its rank in the test schedule and whether it failed.
    As a good schedule executes failing test cases early, every passed test case
    reduces the schedule's quality if it precedes a failing test case. Each test
    case is rewarded by the total number of failed test cases; for failed test
    cases it is the same as reward function 'RNFailReward'. For passed test
    cases, the reward is further decreased by the number of failed test cases
    ranked after the passed test case to penalize scheduling passing test cases
    early.
