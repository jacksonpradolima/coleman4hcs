    Pack references (``packs:`` key) are resolved and deep-merged

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : str | Path
        Path to the YAML config file.
    packs_dir : str | Path | None
        Root directory for config packs.  When ``None`` (the default),

    ------
    FileNotFoundError

    pydantic.ValidationError
