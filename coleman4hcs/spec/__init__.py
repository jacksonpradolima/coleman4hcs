"""
coleman4hcs.spec - Typed run specification models.

Pydantic v2 models that represent the full resolved run definition,
replacing ad-hoc TOML dict access with self-validating schemas.

Classes
-------
ExecutionSpec
    Execution-level settings (parallelism, repetitions).
ExperimentSpec
    Experiment-level settings (datasets, policies, rewards).
AlgorithmSpec
    Per-algorithm hyper-parameter block.
HCSConfigurationSpec
    HCS-specific flags.
ContextualInformationSpec
    Contextual feature configuration.
ResultsSpec
    Results sink settings.
CheckpointSpec
    Checkpoint persistence settings.
TelemetrySpec
    OpenTelemetry export settings.
RunSpec
    Top-level experiment specification (composes all sub-specs).
SweepAxis
    A single sweep dimension (grid or zip).
SweepSpec
    Multi-axis sweep definition.

Functions
---------
compute_run_id
    Deterministic run identifier from a resolved ``RunSpec``.
load_spec
    Load a ``RunSpec`` from a YAML file with optional pack resolution.
save_resolved
    Persist a resolved ``RunSpec`` as canonical JSON.
