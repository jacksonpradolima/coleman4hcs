### Solving the Test Case Prioritization using Multi-Armed Bandit Algorithms

**COLEMAN** (_**C**ombinatorial V**O**lati**LE** **M**ulti-Armed B**AN**dit_) is a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) based approach designed
to address the Test Case Prioritization in Continuous Integration (TCPCI) Environments in a cost-effective way.

We designed **COLEMAN** to be generic regarding the programming language in the system under test,
and adaptive to different contexts and testers' guidelines.

Modeling a MAB-based approach for TCPCI problem gives us some advantages in relation to studies found in the literature, as follows:

- It learns how to incorporate the feedback from the application of the test cases thus incorporating  diversity in the test suite prioritization;
- It uses a policy to deal with the Exploration vs Exploitation (EvE) dilemma, thus mitigating the problem of beginning without knowledge (learning) and adapting to changes in the execution environment, for instance, the fact that some test cases are added (new test cases) and removed (obsolete test cases) from one cycle to another (volatility of test cases);
- It is model-free. The technique is independent of the development environment and programming language, and does not require any analysis in the code level;
- It is more lightweight, that is, needs only the historical failure data to execute, and has higher performance.

In this way, this repository contains the COLEMAN's implementation.
For more information about **COLEMAN** read **Ref1** in [References](#references).

Furthermore, this repository contains the adaptation to deal with Highly-Configurable System (HCS) context through two strategies:
- **Variant Test Set Strategy** (VTS) that relies on the test set specific for each variant; and
- **Whole Test Set Strategy** (WST) that prioritizes the test set composed by the union of the test cases of all variants.

For more information about **WTS** and **VTS** read **Ref2** in [References](#references).

On the other hand, we extended **COLEMAN** to consider the context surrouding in each CY Cycle. The extended version
we named as **CONSTANTINE** (_**CON**textual te**S**t priori**T**iz**A**tion for co**NT**inuous **INE**gration_).

**CONSTANTINE** can use any feature given a dataset, for instance:
- Test Case Duration (Duration): The time spent by a test case to execute;
- Number of Test Ran Methods (NumRan): The number of test methods executed during the test, considering that some test
methods are not executed due to some previous test method(s) have been failed;
- Number of Test Failed Methods (NumErrors): The number of test methods which failed during the test.
- Test Case Age (TcAge): This feature measures how long the test case exists and is given by a number which
is incremented for each new CI Cycle in that the test case is used;
- Test Case Change (ChangeType): Considers whether a test case changed. If a test case is changed from a commit
to another, there is a high probability that the alteration was performed because some change in the software needs
to be tested. If the test case was changed, we could detect and consider if the test case was renamed, or it added
or removed some methods;
- Cyclomatic Complexity (McCabe): This feature considers the complexity of McCabe.
High complexity can be related to a more elaborated test case;
- Test Size (SLOC): Typically, size of a test case refers to either the lines of code or the number of
`assertions` in a test case. This feature is note correlated with coverage. For instance,
if we have two tests t_1 and t_2 and both cover a method, but t_2 have more assertions than t_1, consequently,
t_2 have higher chances to detect failures.

In order to use this `version`, use any Contextual-MAB available, for instance, LinUCB and SWLinUCB.

# Datasets

The datasets used in the examples (and much more datasets) are available at [Harvard Dataverse Repository](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/gres-ufpr).
You can create your own dataset using out [GitLab CI - Torrent tool](https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/gitlabci-torrent) or our adapted version from [TravisTorrent tool](https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/travistorrent-tools).
Besides that, you can extract relevant information about each system using our tool named [TCPI - Dataset - Utils](https://github.com/jacksonpradolima/tcpci-dataset-utils).

# About the files input

**COLEMAN** considers two kind of *csv files*: **features-engineered** and **data-variants**.
The second file, **data-variants.csv**, is used by the HCS, and it represents all results from all variants.
The information is organized by commit and variant.

- **features-engineered.csv** contains the following information:
  - **Id**: unique numeric identifier of the test execution;
  - **Name**: unique numeric identifier of the test case;
  - **BuildId**: a value uniquely identifying the build;
  - **Duration**: approximated runtime of the test case;
  - **LastRun**: previous last execution of the test case as *DateTime*;
  - **Verdict**: test verdict of this test execution (Failed: 1, Passed: 0).

- **data-variants.csv** contains all information that **features-engineered.csv** has, and in addition the following information:
  - **Variant**: variant name.

In this way,  **features-engineered.csv** organize the information for a single system or variant, and
**data-variants.csv** track the information for all variants used during the software life-cycle (for each commit).

During the **COLEMAN**'s execution, we use **data-variants** to identify the variants used in a current commit and apply the **WTS** strategy.

For **CONSTANTINE**, additional columns can be used and represents a contextual information. In this way, you define
what kind of information can be used!

#  Using the tool

To use COLEMAN, you need to provide the necessary configurations. This includes setting up environment variables and configuration files.

Configure the utility by editing the `config.toml` file located in the project's root directory.
The file contains various sections for configuring Execution, Experiment, and Algorithms.
Modify the values as per your project's requirements. Here's an example of the config.toml file:

```toml

##  MAB Policies Available

The following MAB Policies are available on **COLEMAN**:

| **Policy**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Use Case**                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Random**        | Selects actions purely based on random choice without any preference.                                                                                                                                                                   | Used as a baseline to compare with other more sophisticated policies. Doesn't use prior knowledge.                               |
| **Greedy**        | Always selects the action with the highest estimated reward. Exploits current knowledge without exploring other options.                                                                                                                | Effective in environments where reward probabilities are static and unchanging.                                                  |
| **EpsilonGreedy** | This is a variation of the Greedy policy. With probability \( \epsilon \), a random action is selected (exploration), and with probability \( 1 - \epsilon \), the action with the highest estimated reward is selected (exploitation). | Useful in environments with uncertainty about the optimal action or when the environment changes over time.                       |
| **UCB**           | Selects actions based on both their estimated rewards and the uncertainty around these rewards. Balances exploration and exploitation.                                                                                                  | Effective when trials are limited and there's a need to explore and exploit simultaneously.                                       |
| **SlMAB**         | Sliding-window Multi-Armed Bandit (SlMAB) approach, which uses a fixed-size sliding window to consider only recent feedback. The window size determines the trade-off between short-term and long-term rewards.                         | Suitable for non-stationary environments where the optimal action can change over time and recent actions are more indicative.    |
| **FRRMAB**        | A more sophisticated MAB policy that considers feedback from previous actions using a sliding window to adjust estimated rewards for future decisions.                                                                                  | Beneficial in dynamic environments where actions' reward probabilities change and feedback from previous actions is valuable.     |

and the following Contextual MABs for **CONSTANTINE**:

| **Policy**        | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | **Use Case**                                                                                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **LinUCB**        | Incorporates linear regression with UCB. Uses contextual information of the arms to estimate the reward. The uncertainty bonus is combined with a linear estimate of the expected reward.                                                    | Best for environments with contextual information where the relationship between context and reward can be linearly approximated. |
| **SWLinUCB**      | A combination of LinUCB and sliding window approach. It uses the recent contextual information of the arms within a sliding window to better estimate the reward in non-stationary environments.                                         | Ideal for non-stationary environments with contextual information where recent context-reward relationships are more indicative.  |

Note: you can execute all the MAB and Contextual MAB policies together if you have the proper data input.

## Running for Non-HCS System

To execute **COLEMAN** for a non-HCS system, first update the variables in the provided **TOML** file:

- `datasets_dir = "examples"`
- `datasets = ["fakedata"]` 

Subsequently, you can run the program with the following command:

```
python main.py
```

## Running for an HCS system

For HCS systems, we provide two distinct strategies to determine optimal solutions for variants:
**WTS** (Whole Test Set Strategy) and **VTS** (Variant Test Set Strategy).
You can learn more about these in **Ref2** under the [References](#references) section.

When employing the **WTS** and **VTS** strategies, regard `datasets_dir` as the directory housing your system.
For the **WTS** approach, variants of a system are discerned from subfolders within the `datasets_dir` directory.
Essentially, `datasets_dir` symbolizes the project name.
This differentiation in execution methodology between HCS and non-HCS systems is crucial,
alongside the `wts_strategy` variable. For clarity, please inspect our example directory.

### Whole Test Set Strategy

The **WTS** strategy prioritizes the test set composed by the union of the test cases of all variants.
To employ this strategy, modify the **TOML** file as follows:

- `wts_strategy = True`;

For a practical demonstration, set `datasets = ["dune@total"]`
(a dataset amalgamating test cases from all variants)
and `datasets_dir = "examples/core@dune-common"`.
This provides a concise example using the Dune dataset.
More details on the dataset are available under [Datasets](#datasets).

### Variant Test Set Strategy

Contrastingly, the **VTS** approach evaluates each variant as an isolated system.
To harness this strategy, adjust the **TOML** file accordingly:

- `wts_strategy = False`;

As example, use `datasets = ["dune@debian_10 clang-7-libcpp-17", "dune@debian_11 gcc-10-20",
"dune@ubuntu_20_04 clang-10-20"]` and `datasets_dir = "examples/core@dune-common"`
to run one small example using Dune dataset (See [Datasets](#datasets)).
Now, we consider each variant as single system.

As a hands-on example, set `datasets =
["dune@debian_10 clang-7-libcpp-17", "dune@debian_11 gcc-10-20", "dune@ubuntu_20_04 clang-10-20"]`
and `datasets_dir = "examples/core@dune-common"`.
This offers a succinct example using the Dune dataset, treating each variant as a unique system.
Further insights into the dataset are available in the [Datasets](#datasets) section.
